* Simulation of Linear Model Data 

This package allows you to simulation multivariate linear model with single and multiple response variables. This package allows users to specify properties such as which principal components of predictors are relevant for response and how the eigenvalues of predictors decay. This gives full control of covariance structure of simulated data to the user.

* To Do

- [x] Add validation for input parameters
- [x] Include Bivariate simulation where the correlation between two response are also considered
- [ ] Some plotting function
- [ ] Provide easy shiny interface for simulation
